# Point-in-time contract

This collector stores predictor data for forecasting. A historical backtest must never see information that was unavailable at the simulated forecast instant.

## Stored dates

- `reference_date`: period the observation describes.
- `vintage_date`: UTC date on which this collector stored that version.
- `release_date`: source publication date when explicitly supported.
- `available_at`: earliest defensible instant at which this stored vintage could have been known.
- `collected_at`: timestamp of this pipeline run.

`availability_basis` is one of `official_timestamp`, `official_date`, `archived_release`, `first_seen`, `inferred`, `unknown`.

By default `get_series_as_of()` accepts only `official_timestamp`, `official_date`, `archived_release`, and `first_seen`. `inferred` and `unknown` require explicit opt-in.

## Historical revisions

A revised value for an already stored `(series_id, reference_date)` must not reuse the original publication timestamp. Unless the source exposes explicit evidence for the revision release, the revised vintage is stamped:

- `available_at = collected_at`
- `availability_basis = first_seen`
- `release_date = NULL`

This prevents a 2026 revision of a 2024 observation from appearing in a 2024 backtest.

## Same-day revisions

The fleet schema uses `vintage_date DATE`. Two different intraday revisions therefore cannot be represented without overwriting one information set. Predictor collectors fail closed when an already stored vintage changes again on the same UTC date. Retry after the UTC date changes rather than rewriting history.

## As-of guarantee

`get_series_as_of(series_id, as_of)` filters on `available_at <= as_of` before ranking vintages. A later revision therefore cannot mask the vintage that was actually current at the historical instant.
