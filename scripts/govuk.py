"""Bounded HTTP access to GOV.UK publication pages and their attachments.

Both v0.1 sources are GOV.UK pages that expose the same three things: a set of
downloadable attachments whose URLs carry a content hash that changes on every
republication, an official change history of publication timestamps, and the
ordinary asset CDN headers. Duplicating the host allowlist, retry budget and
download ceiling per source file would put the network policy in two places and
let them drift. This module is the single justified shared module in this
repository; source-specific parsing stays in the two `extract_*.py` files.
